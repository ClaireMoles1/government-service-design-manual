The confirmation page should be the last page of the transaction.

These pages should let the user know:

* that they have successfully completed the transaction
* their reference number if there is one
* what further actions they need to perform, and when
* what further actions they can expect from the service, and when
* who they should contact with any queries or complaints
* about any related information and services

Use this pattern to link to the [feedback page](/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/feedback-pages) for the service:

> [What did you think of this service?]() (takes 30 seconds)

> `<p><a href=“https://www.gov.uk/done/name-of-your-service”>What did you think of this service?</a> (takes 30 seconds)</p>`
